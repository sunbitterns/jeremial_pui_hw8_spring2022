### Description

### Using Website
Hover over the alphabet to display the poem.
To reset, click on the reset button on the top right.

### External Libraries
* Animate.css

### Iteration from HW7

### Major Challenges
The main challenge was figuring out how to simplify my JS code
because there was a lot of repetive code for applying colors and changing letter of the alphabet. I managed to condense the functions for the permahover state and applying color to the first word of each line in the poem, but the function for linking each letter to its respective line is still very long. 

### To-Do before Wednesday
1. Make Lines appear in set position.
2. Reverse animations on reset. 
3. Remove color when you move to next line. 
4. Info on school shootings? (information aspect)
5. Record Video
6. Suddenly entire site broke whyyyyyyyyyyyy
